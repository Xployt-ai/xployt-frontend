# Subscription System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a complete subscription system that:
1. Checks if a user is a Pro subscriber
2. Shows a "Subscribe Now" button for non-Pro users
3. Opens a payment modal when clicking subscribe
4. Processes the $20 monthly payment
5. Grants Pro status and 500 tokens immediately
6. Shows "Cancel Subscription" for Pro users

## Subscription Validation Logic

### How It Works

The subscription system validates Pro status based on **transaction history** rather than just a database flag:

1. **Subscription Period**: Each subscription is valid for exactly **1 month** from the payment date
2. **Transaction-Based**: The system finds all `pro_monthly` transactions and uses the most recent one
3. **End Date Calculation**: `subscription_end_date = last_pro_monthly_date + 1 month`
4. **Validity Check**: User is Pro if current date is within the subscription period
5. **Grace After Cancellation**: Even if cancelled, user keeps Pro access until end of paid period

### Example Timeline

```
Day 1: User subscribes → pro_monthly transaction created
Day 1-30: User has Pro access (is_pro = true)
Day 15: User cancels → is_cancelled = true, but is_pro still = true
Day 30: Subscription expires → is_pro = false
```

### Key Function: `calculateSubscriptionValidity()`

This function:
- Fetches all `pro_monthly` transactions from credit history
- Finds the most recent payment
- Calculates end date (start + 1 month)
- Checks if current date is within the period
- Returns: `{ isValid, endDate, startDate, daysRemaining }`

### Benefits

✅ **Tamper-Proof**: Status calculated from immutable transaction history  
✅ **Fair**: Users get full month access even after cancelling  
✅ **Accurate**: Always shows correct days remaining  
✅ **Automatic**: No cron jobs needed for expiration checks  

## Updated Files

Network module for subscription-related API calls:

**Key Features:**
- `calculateSubscriptionValidity(transactions)` - Client-side validation function
  - Finds last `pro_monthly` transaction

  - Returns validity status and days remaining

**Endpoints:**
- `getProStatus()` - GET `/api/v1/users/pro-status`
  - Fetches backend status
  - Validates against transaction history
  - Returns: `{ is_pro: boolean, subscription_end_date: string, subscription_start_date: string, is_cancelled: boolean, days_remaining: number }`
- `subscribeToPro()` - POST `/api/v1/users/subscribe`
  - Charges $20 and grants Pro status with 500 tokens
  - Creates `pro_monthly` transaction
  - Returns: `{ message: string, credits_added: number }`
- `unsubscribeFromPro()` - POST `/api/v1/users/unsubscribe`
  - Sets `is_cancelled = true` on backend

### 2. `src/components/PaymentModal.tsx`
Payment confirmation modal that appears when subscribing:

**Features:**
- Shows Pro Plan details ($20/month, 500 tokens)
- Displays payment summary with total
- "Cancel" and "Pay $20.00" buttons
- Loading state while processing
- Error handling with red alert messages
- Calls `subscribeToPro()` on payment confirmation
- Notifies parent component on success

## Updated Files

### `src/features/BillCard.tsx`
Enhanced to support both Pro and non-Pro states with cancellation logic:

**For Non-Pro Users:**
- Shows "Subscribe Now" button (green)
- Opens PaymentModal when clicked
- Refreshes status after successful subscription

**For Pro Users (Active):**
- Shows subscription details
- Displays next billing date
- Shows days until renewal
- Shows "Cancel Subscription" button (red)
- Calls `unsubscribeFromPro()` when cancelled

**For Pro Users (Cancelled but Still Active):**
- Shows "Cancelled" status in yellow
- Displays "Access expires on [date]"
- Shows days remaining
- Shows "Resubscribe" button (green)
- User can resubscribe before expiration

**Loading State:**
- Shows "Loading subscription status..." while fetching

## User Flow

### Non-Pro User Journey:
1. User visits Bill/Subscription page
2. Sees "Pro Plan" card with "Subscribe Now" button
3. Clicks "Subscribe Now"
4. Payment modal appears with plan details
5. Reviews:
   - $20/month price
   - 500 tokens per month
   - Automatic renewal
   - Total: $20.00
6. Clicks "Pay $20.00"
7. Backend processes payment and:
   - Deducts $20 from user account
   - Sets `is_pro = true`
   - Adds 500 tokens to balance
   - Records subscription start date
8. Modal closes automatically
9. Card updates to show Pro status with "Cancel Subscription" button

### Pro User Journey (Cancellation):
1. User visits Bill/Subscription page
2. Sees "Pro Plan" active with subscription details
3. Clicks "Cancel Subscription"
4. Backend sets `is_cancelled = true`
5. Card updates to show:
   - "Cancelled" status (yellow)
   - "Access expires on [date]"
   - Days remaining
   - "Resubscribe" button
6. User keeps Pro access until end of paid month
7. After expiration, reverts to non-Pro state
8. Can resubscribe anytime during the remaining period

## Backend API Requirements

The backend needs these endpoints:

### GET /api/v1/users/pro-status
```json
{
  "is_pro": true,
  "is_cancelled": false,
  "subscription_start_date": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "subscription_end_date": "2025-02-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Note:** The frontend will calculate actual `is_pro` status by checking if a `pro_monthly` transaction exists within the last month. This ensures accuracy even if backend flag is stale.

### POST /api/v1/users/subscribe
**Action:**
- Charge $20 from user's payment method
- Create a `pro_monthly` transaction with amount = 500
- Add 500 credits to user's balance
- Set `is_cancelled = false` (in case resubscribing)
- Record subscription start date

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Successfully subscribed to Pro plan",
  "credits_added": 500
}
```

**Important:** The `pro_monthly` transaction is the source of truth for subscription validity.

### POST /api/v1/users/unsubscribe
**Action:**
- Set `is_cancelled = true` in user record
- Stop automatic monthly renewals
- **Do NOT change is_pro flag** - user keeps access until end of paid period
- Keep existing credits (don't deduct)
- Record cancellation date

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Subscription cancelled. Access remains until [end_date]"
}
```

**Important:** User keeps Pro status until their paid month expires. Frontend calculates this from the last `pro_monthly` transaction date.

## Monthly Billing Automation

The backend should have a scheduled job that:
1. Runs daily
2. Finds Pro users whose last `pro_monthly` transaction is exactly 1 month old
3. **Only process if `is_cancelled = false`**
4. For each eligible user:
   - Attempt to charge $20 from payment method
   - If successful:
     - Create new `pro_monthly` transaction with 500 tokens
     - Add 500 tokens to balance
   - If payment fails:
     - Set `is_cancelled = true`
     - Send payment failed notification
     - User keeps access until current period expires (no immediate cutoff)

## Features

✅ **Transaction-Based Validation**: Pro status calculated from `pro_monthly` transaction history  
✅ **Conditional UI**: Shows different content for Pro vs non-Pro users  
✅ **Payment Modal**: Clean payment confirmation interface  
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Status refreshes after subscribe/unsubscribe  
✅ **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if payment fails  
✅ **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators during API calls  
✅ **Token Grant**: Automatically adds 500 tokens on subscription  
✅ **Monthly Billing**: $20 charged automatically each month (if not cancelled)  
✅ **Grace Period**: Users keep Pro access even after cancelling until period ends  
✅ **Days Remaining**: Shows exact days left in subscription  
✅ **Resubscribe**: Cancelled users can reactivate before expiration  
✅ **Next Billing Date**: Shows when next charge will occur  
✅ **Cancel Anytime**: Users can unsubscribe at any time  
✅ **Fair Expiration**: Full month access guaranteed after payment

## Integration Notes

1. Make sure the backend API endpoints match the paths in `subscription.ts`
2. The payment processing should be handled by the backend (not frontend)
3. Consider adding Stripe or another payment gateway integration
4. Add email notifications for subscription events
5. Consider adding a grace period for failed payments

## Security Considerations

- Payment processing must be done server-side
- Never store credit card details in frontend
- Use secure payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Validate subscription status on every API request
- Log all subscription events for audit trail
